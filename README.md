📝 Text notes – Record thoughts, plans, and reflections.

📷 Images – Capture moments using photos or screenshots.

🎙️ Voice notes – Speak your mind and store audio memories.

🎥 Videos – Embed short clips or record daily vlogs.

🗓️ Date-wise organization – Entries are neatly categorized by date, making retrieval seamless.
